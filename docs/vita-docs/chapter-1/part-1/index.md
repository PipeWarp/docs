# Part 1: Setting up WSL
### haha linux go brrr


## SKIP THIS CHAPTER IF YOU ARE USING Linux!
This section is for the users that are on windows and don't have WSL (Windows Subsytem for Linux). 
Don't worry if you don't know what Linux or WSL is, you'll learn about that in this chapter and some basics along with it.



# Part 1: What is Linux?
Linux is an Kernel (or operating system) used by many people, even people like NASA. It's popular because of its customizability, privacy, and more. Linux is shared in Distributions (distros), which is the Linux kernel, but with many feautures and improvments ontop. You can think of it like a different versions of windows.
For this guide we'll be using one of the most popular distros, Ubuntu.

# Part 2: How do I get Ubuntu?

Using Ubuntu with windows is easy. We could get a virtual machine, but assuming you don't know a thing about Linux, we will use WSL (windows subsytem for Linux), which allows us to use the Ubuntu Terminal with Windows.
The Simplest method is as follows:

* Step 1: Open the Microsoft Store and search Ubuntu (insert image of Ubuntu on windows store)
* Step 2: Click on the first result (which should be Ubuntu as shown above)
* Step 3: Download Ubuntu!

You can easily lauch it from the start menu.

# Step 3: What do I do now?
Here are some easy commands to help you get started for the next tutorial.
```
ls              <- List all the files/folders in a directory
cd              <- Enter a folder
nano [FILENAME] <- Edit a file/create a file (you can use other editors if you want)
rm              <- Remove a file
sudo [COMMAND]  <- Run a command as admin
```
