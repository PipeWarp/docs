Welcome to the PSVita Homebrew Guide by PipeWarp! This guide will teach you the basics of making C/C++ Homebrew for the PSVita along with the basics of building applications with Linux!


I would like to thank the following people:
- Team Molecule for the entire homebrew scene
- The Vita Nuova server and all the members inside
- Bythos, Rinnegatamante, S1ngyy and everyone else in the Vita Nuova Discord for code help for when I was originally learning this
- Samilop "Cimmerian" Iter for helping me fixing my vita (check out his [troubleshooting guide for the vita!](https://samilops2.gitbook.io/vita-troubleshooting-guide/))
- Kiiro Yakumo for proof reading


Have fun making homebrew!
